Test: Debris Depositing Doors

Experimenter: Trent Whalen

When: Feb. 6, 2019

Goal: Control debris storage compartment door with a servo motor. The door
    should not 	open when depositing blocks or balls. When opening the
    compartment door, all blocks and balls should exit the compartment.

Results: The compartment doors did not perceivably move when dropping up to any 
    combination of two blocks and one ball. When opening the compartment door,
    all blocks and balls exited the compartment.

    The order blocks and balls were dropped had no influence on the doors
    ability to remain closed. Dropping the ball and then blocks into the storage
    compartment made the debris exit furthest from the compartment, but any
    order of placement allowed all debris to exit.

    Nearly always after opening a door, a block would obstruct the door from
    reclosing. This will not be an issue for raised storage compartments but
    must be addressed for ground-level compartments.

Code: Refer to 'gate.ino'.
